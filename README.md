## Installation
### 1. Clone code
```
    git clone git@github.com:SY-Xuan/IICS.git
    cd ./IICS
```

### 2. Install dependency python packages
```
    conda create --name IICS --file requirements.txt
``` 

### 3. Prepare dataset
Download Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, MSMT17 from website and put the zip file under the directory like
```
./data
â”œâ”€â”€ dukemtmc
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ raw
|       â””â”€â”€DukeMTMC-reID.zip
â”œâ”€â”€ market1501
|   â””â”€â”€ raw
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ Market-1501-v15.09.15.zip
|â”€â”€ msmt17
|   â””â”€â”€ raw
|       â””â”€â”€ MSMT17_V2.zip
```
## Usage
### 1. Download trained model
* [Market1501](https://pkueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/shiyu_xuan_stu_pku_edu_cn/Er0V5oh4nadBliFIrzGRsl8BGJ-ibjAUt64t4oN10n_rhQ?e=YIJVvU)
* [DukeMTMC-ReID](https://pkueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/shiyu_xuan_stu_pku_edu_cn/Er0V5oh4nadBliFIrzGRsl8BGJ-ibjAUt64t4oN10n_rhQ?e=YIJVvU)
* [MSMT17](https://pkueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/shiyu_xuan_stu_pku_edu_cn/Er0V5oh4nadBliFIrzGRsl8BGJ-ibjAUt64t4oN10n_rhQ?e=YIJVvU)

### 2. Evaluate Model
Change the checkpoint path in the ./script/test_market.sh
```
sh ./script/test_market.sh
```

### 3. Train Model
You need to download ResNet-50 imagenet pretrained model and change the checkpoint path in the ./script/train_market.sh
```
sh ./script/train_market.sh
```

We also provide a better version of our method which can adaptively determine clustering number by setting a similarity threshold
```
sh ./script/train_market_threshold.sh
```
